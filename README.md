# B2B Login & Authorization System
## Overview
- This project was developed in Spring 2024 for CS366 - Systems Programming
- It demonstrates a proof of concept using ASCII math, it does not use a secure encryption protocol.
- My teammate and I built a sample use case of logging in an then connecting to an API with Libcurl to translate a word.
## Languages/Technologies
- C, Libcurl, Rapidapi
## Notes for further development
- Properly refractor the login and authorization system out so that it can be included as a header file in other programs.
- Fix the memory leak bug. It is likely to be within the code sourced from the internet for working with the APIs.
