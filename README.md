# B2B Login & Authorization System
## Overview
- This project was developed in Spring 2024 for CS366 - Systems Programming.
- It demonstrates a proof of concept using ASCII math, it does not use a secure encryption protocol.
- My teammate and I built a sample use case of logging in an then connecting to an API with Libcurl to translate a word.
## Languages/Technologies
- C, Libcurl
- RapidAPI
## Notes for further development
- Fix the memory leak bug. It is likely to be within the Libcurl code for working with the API.
